# ISSUES

## Guide and Examples pages not mobile responsive

Guide subpages and Examples are not mobile responsive.
Only the Manual/Wiki page has proper mobile layout.

Pages affected:
- docs/cli.html
- docs/js-api.html
- docs/mcp.html
- docs/examples.html

Root cause: Missing site template in build script.
Need unified responsive template like wiki uses.

## TREF blocks not draggable on mobile in examples

Due to missing mobile optimization, TREF blocks cannot be dragged
on mobile devices in some examples (e.g., chat example).

Touch events may be blocked by non-responsive layout or overlapping elements.
