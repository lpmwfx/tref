# ISSUES

## Guide and Examples pages not mobile responsive

Guide subpages and Examples are not mobile responsive.
Only the Manual/Wiki page has proper mobile layout.

Pages affected:
- docs/cli.html
- docs/js-api.html
- docs/mcp.html
- docs/examples.html

Root cause: Missing site template in build script.
Need unified responsive template like wiki uses.

## Wiki pages text overflow on mobile

URL: http://localhost:8888/wiki/pages/block-format.html

In mobile mode:
- Long text (SHA-256 hashes in code blocks) overflows to the right
- Code blocks need `overflow-x: auto` or `word-break`
- Font styling differs from desktop (missing or different font)

See: screenshot/image copy 3.png

## Guide cards too tall on desktop

URL: http://localhost:8888/guide.html

Cards are too tall in desktop mode - should be more square-shaped.
Same issue as examples.html cards.

## Builder dark theme - input text invisible

URL: http://localhost:8888/builder.html

In dark mode, text in input fields is not visible.
Missing CSS for input field colors in dark theme.

Note: Console errors about `content_script.js` are browser extension related, not our code.

## Example cards not responsive on desktop

URL: http://localhost:8888/examples.html

Cards on examples.html don't arrange responsively.
- Desktop: Cards are tall and ugly (not well-proportioned)
- Mobile: Cards stack nicely

Need CSS grid/flexbox adjustment for desktop card layout.

## TREF blocks not draggable on mobile in examples

Due to missing mobile optimization, TREF blocks cannot be dragged
on mobile devices in some examples (e.g., chat example).

Touch events may be blocked by non-responsive layout or overlapping elements.

## TREF hover menu not responsive on mobile (builder) - FIXED

**Status:** Fixed in TrefWrapper.js

**Solution:**
Extracted positioning logic to `#positionActions()` method.
Now called from both `mouseenter` (desktop) and `#toggleActions()` (mobile).

**Related CSS concern:**
Site-level CSS (`overflow-x: hidden` on html/body) might clip positioned menus.
Vanilla Framework may also add styles affecting absolute positioning.
