# ISSUES

## Guide and Examples pages not mobile responsive

Guide subpages and Examples are not mobile responsive.
Only the Manual/Wiki page has proper mobile layout.

Pages affected:
- docs/cli.html
- docs/js-api.html
- docs/mcp.html
- docs/examples.html

Root cause: Missing site template in build script.
Need unified responsive template like wiki uses.

## Wiki pages text overflow on mobile - FIXED

**Root cause:** CSS Grid children have `min-width: auto` by default, preventing
shrinking below content size. Also needed `word-break: break-all` for inline code.

**Fixes in wiki.css:**
- Added `min-width: 0` to `.wiki-layout`, `.wiki-main`, `.wiki-article`
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to containers
- Changed inline code to `word-break: break-all` for SHA-256 hashes
- Code blocks now use `max-width: calc(100vw - 2rem)` with scrollable content

## Guide cards too tall on desktop - FIXED

**Root cause:** `.card-grid` goes to 4 columns at 1024px, but container is 800px.

**Fix:** Added `.card-grid--narrow` modifier class (max 2 columns) to guide.html and examples.html.

## Builder dark theme - input text invisible - FIXED

**Root cause:** `--gray-100` is remapped to a dark color in dark mode, so
`color: var(--gray-100)` became dark-on-dark.

**Fix:** Changed to fixed hex color `#f1f5f9` in tref-site.css:645

## Example cards not responsive on desktop - FIXED

Same fix as guide.html: Added `.card-grid--narrow` class.

## Wiki pages inconsistent fonts

URL: http://localhost:8888/wiki/pages/block-format.html

Font styling is not consistent across wiki pages.
Some pages have different fonts than others.

Need to ensure all wiki pages use the same font stack.

## AI Chat example - ugly form and stacked source blocks - FIXED

**Root cause:** Chat CSS styles were removed during refactor.

**Fix:** Added section 11 to tref-site.css with chat styling:
- `.chat-send` button with TREF gradient
- `#source-blocks` with flexbox horizontal layout
- Full dark mode support

## TREF blocks not draggable on mobile in examples

Due to missing mobile optimization, TREF blocks cannot be dragged
on mobile devices in some examples (e.g., chat example).

Touch events may be blocked by non-responsive layout or overlapping elements.

## TREF hover menu not responsive on mobile (builder) - FIXED

**Status:** Fixed in TrefWrapper.js

**Solution:**
Extracted positioning logic to `#positionActions()` method.
Now called from both `mouseenter` (desktop) and `#toggleActions()` (mobile).

**Related CSS concern:**
Site-level CSS (`overflow-x: hidden` on html/body) might clip positioned menus.
Vanilla Framework may also add styles affecting absolute positioning.
