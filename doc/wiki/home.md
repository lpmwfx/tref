# TREF Manual

Welcome to the TREF documentation. TREF (Traceable Reference Format) is an open format for verifiable, shareable knowledge blocks.

## What is TREF?

TREF blocks are self-contained units of knowledge that combine:

* **Content** - The actual text or data
* **Metadata** - Author, license, timestamps
* **References** - Source links, archived snippets, search prompts
* **Lineage** - Parent block reference for derived content

Each block has a unique SHA-256 ID generated from its content, making it tamper-evident and verifiable.

## Quick Links

* **Getting Started** - Install and create your first block
* **Block Format** - Understand the structure
* **CLI Reference** - Command-line tools
* **JavaScript API** - Browser and Node.js integration

## Why TREF?

In the AI era, knowledge needs backbone:

* **Traceability** - Know where information came from
* **Verifiability** - Detect if content was modified
* **Portability** - Drag, copy, share without losing context
* **Attribution** - References travel with the content
