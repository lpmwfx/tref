# PHASES

Dynamic phase description for AIBlocks project.

## Current Phase: 2 - Publisher Core

Build the publishing mechanism for blocks.

### 2a: ID Generation
- Content-based ID generation (sha256 of canonical JSON)
- Canonical JSON serialization (sorted keys, no whitespace)
- Test ID generation determinism

### 2b: Publishing Functions
- Publish draft → AIBlock (add ID)
- Derive block (set parent, preserve refs)
- Validate block integrity (ID matches content)

### 2c: File I/O
- Save block to .aiblock file
- Load block from .aiblock file
- Export to PUBLISH_DIR

## Completed: Phase 1 - Block Format Specification

Format spec v1.0 complete. Full name: **AIBlocks - Traceable Knowledge Format**

Deliverables (done):
- Block schema (v, id, content, meta, origin, refs, parent)
- Reference types (url, archive, search, hash)
- ID format: sha256:<64 hex chars>
- Canonical JSON spec for ID generation
- Zod schemas with JSDoc types
- Security section (safe by construction)
- License-as-format philosophy

---

## Phase 3: Wrapper JS

Runtime component for browser/website integration.

Deliverables:
- Visual AIBlock icon (SVG)
- Drag/copy/download interactions
- Data transfer (JSON, text/plain, uri-list)
- Zero dependencies, minimal footprint

---

## Phase 4: Publisher CLI (stdio/MCP)

Terminal and AI integration.

Deliverables:
- CLI interface: `aiblock publish < draft.md > block.aiblock`
- MCP server for Claude/AI tools
- stdin/stdout for piping
- Batch processing

---

## Phase 5: Python Publisher

Build-time publishing for pipelines and static sites.

Deliverables:
- Block generation from markdown files
- Batch export for static site generators
- CI/CD integration patterns

---

## Phase 6: Validation & Verification

Cross-block integrity and reference checking.

Deliverables:
- Reference validation (URL alive, hash match)
- Lineage tree verification
- Duplicate/conflict detection
- Comparison across publishers
