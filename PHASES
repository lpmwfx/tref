# PHASES

Dynamic phase description for AIBlocks project.

## Current Phase: 1 - Block Format Specification

Define the core format with publisher requirements as constraints.

Deliverables:
- Block schema (id, type, content, metadata)
- Lineage structure (parentId/derivedFrom, version)
- Reference types (URL, archive snippet, search prompt, hash)
- Serialization spec (field order, encoding for deterministic hashing)
- Zod schemas with JSDoc types

Constraint: Format must support content-based ID generation and lineage preservation.

---

## Phase 2: Publisher Core

Build the publishing mechanism for blocks.

### 2a: Lineage Engine
- Create new block version on content change
- Link old version as parent in lineage tree
- Generate deterministic content-based ID
- Cryptographic hash for integrity

### 2b: Package Generator
- Single-file bundle output (JSON + embedded wrapper)
- Static file export (`/ai-blocks/<id>.json`)
- Minimal embeddable format

---

## Phase 3: Wrapper JS

Runtime component for browser/website integration.

Deliverables:
- Visual AI-Block icon (SVG)
- Load block data on demand
- Drag/copy/download interactions
- Deliver data payload (not icon) on action
- Zero dependencies, minimal footprint

---

## Phase 4: Python Publisher

Build-time publishing for pipelines and static sites.

Deliverables:
- Block generation from sources (MD, JSON, YAML)
- Normalization and serialization
- Batch export for static site generators
- CI/CD integration patterns

---

## Phase 5: Validation & Verification

Cross-block integrity and reference checking.

Deliverables:
- Reference validation (URL alive, hash match)
- Lineage tree verification
- Duplicate/conflict detection
- Comparison across publishers
